## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Employee not found
- **Solution**: Ensure employee is registered with `register_employee()` first

**Issue**: Insufficient leave balance
- **Solution**: Use `add_leave_balance()` to add more days or adjust request dates

**Issue**: Request already approved/rejected
- **Solution**: Can only approve/reject pending requests

**Issue**: Invalid date format
- **Solution**: Use YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., "2024-12-25")
